+++ MOD TOOLS 1.2 (incremental) +++



Installation:


- Unzip the .zip file to a new folder.

- You will see six folders; "bin", "deffiles", "map_source", "mods", "raw", and "zone source", along with two executibles; "mp_tool.exe" and "sp_tool.exe".

- Highlight all folders and both executibles and copy them into your "Call of Duty - World at War" root game directory.

- You will be asked if it is okay to overwrite folders and files. Click "Yes to All" for this operation and any subseuqent ones.


You have now sucessfully installed Mod Tools 1.2. Have fun, and please report any problems to the forums!





**SPECIAL NOTEs**

- This Mod Tools update requires CoD:WaW patch 1.4.

- We recommend that you covert and recompile all mods and custom maps to ensure compatibility with CoD:WaW patch 1.4.

- Patch 1.4 recognizes IWD's in the /usermaps folder. In the case of duplicate files in both /usermaps and /mods folders, the files in /usermaps will take priority.

- This 1.2 update also includes the files from the "CoDWaW - Mod Tools Package 1.1" download that was released in January.



--------------------------------

Issues Fixed:

- Custom models no longer crash the lighting process in Launcher.exe when compiling a map that contains a custom model.
- Converter's "ERROR: dll version number does not match converter version" error has been resolved.
- Launching "mp_usermaps" in the /mods directory no longer causes clients to be kicked when joining the host's game.
